<h1>What font best describes you as a person?</h1>
<br/>
<p>Papyrus is a well known and well reviled font amongst font enthusiasts, rivaled only by its equally gaudy cousin Comic-sans. Ask anyone that cares about these things what their least favorite font is and Papyrus is likely to enter the conversation. But there is charm beneath its surface. There is a subtle sense that Papyrus knows exactly what it is and owns that completely. It is quirky and abnormal. It is jagged and unfinished. It defies convention, and questions your aesthetic sensibilities. These are things I can relate to completely.</p>

<p>I am an entertainer. Most “About Me" pages will only ever be visited once by any single individual. If someone sees this and shows it to someone else, even if it is to collectively balk at it, I will have done my job.</p>

<p>I am a dismantler. In a featureless room with a featureless metal cube, I would find a way to tear it into pieces. I will find the thing no one else has thought of, and exploit it.</p>

<p>I am a solver. I will life coach you against your will. I will break a problem into tiny pieces and find the path of least resistance. All obstacles to results should refer to the previous paragraph.</p>

<p>I am continuous improvement. All tools, processes, and personal beliefs are fair game. Nothing is sacred and everything is on the table at all times. If it doesn’t work, it goes away. If it can be better, it is improved regardless of the politics involved. Everything is thrown into the giant dumpster fire of scrutiny.</p>

<p>I am a maniac and if you let me, I will chew on everything in the room. It is better to have to hold someone back than to have to push them forward.</p>

<p>I am Papyrus. What font best describes you as a person?</p>

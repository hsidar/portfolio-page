<h1>What font best describes you as a person?</h1>
<br/>
<p>Papyrus is a well known and well reviled font amongst font enthusiasts, rivaled only by its equally gaudy cousin Comic-sans. Ask anyone that cares about these things what their least favorite font is and Papyrus is likely to enter the conversation. Yet there is a charm beneath the surface. There is a subtle sense that Papyrus knows exactly what it is and owns that completely. It is quirky and abnormal. It is jagged and unfinished. It defies convention, and questions your aesthetic sensibilities. These are things I can relate to completely.</p>

<p>As part of this career change endeavor, I struggled to create an “About me” page. I found I was unable to properly convey who I was through conventional means. I tried the timid fun facts page. I tried to write a proper bio of myself complete with smiling Linkedin profile picture. I tried to look accessible and normal and relatable. I found that no font truly represented me. Five iterations, and I have arrived at the about page you see here. Everyone I have shown it to has more or less said “Well … that’s all you alright.” followed by career mentoring about why it may be a deterrent in my quest to obtain employment.</p>

<p>Only narcissists are comfortable talking about themselves, so it is at least reassuring that writing this has been uncomfortable. I am not the kind of guy who will proudly tell you that I am the greatest person who ever lived. What you see here is a representation of who I am. Why should it be anything else? Anything else would come across as disingenuous. What I can say in full confidence and without a shred of discomfort is that my best trait is my humility. Humbly speaking: I am the greatest person who has ever lived.</p>

<p>I am an entertainer. Most “About Me" pages will only ever be visited once by any single individual. If someone sees this and shows it to someone else, even if it is to collectively balk at it, I will have done my job.</p>

<p>I am a dismantler. In a featureless room with a featureless metal cube, I would find a way to tear it into pieces. I will find the thing no one else has thought of, and exploit it.</p>

<p>I am a solver. I will life coach you against your will. I will break a problem into tiny pieces and find the path of least resistance. All obstacles to results should refer to the previous paragraph.</p>

<p>I am a grammar-nazi. If you see a mistake on this site, I want to know. If I see a mistake on your site, it will be the first thing I tell you when I feel comfortable doing so.</p>

<p>I am continuous improvement. All tools, processes, and personal beliefs are fair game. Nothing is sacred and everything is on the table at all times. If it doesn’t work, it goes away. If it can be better, it is improved regardless of the politics involved. Everything is thrown into the fire under the assumption that the truth does not burn.</p>

<p>I am a maniac and if you let me, I will chew on everything in the room. It is better to have to hold someone back than to have to push them forward.</p>

<p>I am Papyrus. What font best describes you as a person?</p>

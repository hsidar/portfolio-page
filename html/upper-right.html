<h1>Tenets</h1>

<h2>Learn to love the wall</h2>

<p>Table flipping is a sign you have reached a time of education. Nothing is learned in the comfort zone.</p>

<p>You will see yourself stronger on the other side of every obstacle. Smash your face into every wall and become powerful.</p>

<p>The flip-side of frustration and anger is a blissful pronouncement of brilliance.</p>

<h2>Question your conditioning</h2>

<p>If you get woken up with a punch to the face everyday for the rest of your life, you are still going to have what you would consider to be a good day at some point.</p>

<p>Humanityâ€™s greatest strength is our ability to adapt. It makes us able to survive in any climate. It is also our greatest weakness. We find comfort in our routines. We allow inefficient processes to permeate our lives and slow us down without our knowledge.</p>

<p>I can condition myself to anything. The question then becomes what have I conditioned myself to accept?</p>

<h2>Walk the Golden Path</h2>

<p>Everything should be held up to scrutiny. Everything should be interrogated and challenged.</p>

<p>In every situation, there is a collection of words and actions that if said and done in a certain way will achieve absolute success.</p>

<p>Celebrate every victory with humility, grace, and style.</p>
